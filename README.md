List Pagination and Filtering

Using a common web development technique known as "pagination" enhanced the usability of a web page that contains a list of student names, photos and email addresses.
The code used in this project is plain JavaScript, often referred to as "vanilla" JavaScript.
Thanks to the JavaScript code the webpage displays 10 names at a time and has a navigation system consisting in a series of links at the bottom of the page.
For extra credit also added a search component consisting in an input field and a button that allow searching through the list of students and manipulating the list item to only dispay the items matching the search criteria on the webpage.
This works with a list of any number of students.
